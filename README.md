# Purpose
Repository containing my learning or for-fun projects. Don't expect much use of this code for anybody, nor a lot of readability for external viewers. The repository is public, but I don't aim to generate something of value here.

Likely this hardly gets updates, as I don't expect I have much time for this hobby project besides the many other things that I fill my free time with.

# Graphs

A look at graph algorithms, specifically around program analysis (and transformation) using lark and NetworkX. So far this is lark's python parser and basic callgraph support. We ignore most of the dynamic behavior of python and assume static typing is applied to allow us to statically determine what function is called so we can make a callgraph.
